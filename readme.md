# Codecademy - Computer Science Career Path - Towers of Hanoi 
## Description
A small project based on the towers of [Hanoi game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).

## Goal
To practice using stacks and the basic features of Python.

## Rules of the game
- The game starts with a stack of different sized disks, ordered from largest (on the bottom) to smallest (on the top)
- The objective of the game is to move the disks to form a new stack
- Only one disk can be moved at a time
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and using it to start a new stack, or placing it on top of an existing stack
- Up to three stacks are allowed at any one time
- Larger disks cannot be placed on top of smaller disks

## Implementation
The three stacks will be implemented as instances of a Stack class, with the typical behaviour of a stack (push, pop, peek).
